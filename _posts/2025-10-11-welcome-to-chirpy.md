## Hello World!

Welcome to my newly redesigned website powered by the fantastic [Chirpy Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)! ðŸŽ‰

### What's New?

I've completely migrated from my previous simple Jekyll setup to Chirpy, which brings:

- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive layout that looks great on all devices
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Organized tabs for better content discovery
- **Better SEO**: Built-in optimization features
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes as you prefer
- **Enhanced Search**: Find content quickly and efficiently

### My Focus Areas

This website showcases my work across multiple domains:

- **Open Source Projects**: Contributing to the community with useful tools and extensions
- **TypeScript/JavaScript Development**: Building modern utilities and libraries
- **DevContainer Features**: Enhancing development workflows
- **Mobile Applications**: Specializing in Sailfish OS development
- **SaaS Solutions**: Creating services that solve real user problems

### What's Coming?

I'll be regularly sharing insights about:
- Development best practices
- Open source project updates
- Technical tutorials and guides
- Thoughts on Human-Computer Interaction

Stay tuned for more content, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
