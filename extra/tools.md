# Open-source tools

Most of my previous open-source contributions are no longer publicly accessible, as they were made in the early 2000s. However, I continue to contribute to various projects and occasionally develop simple tools.

## Gnome extensions

* [Firefox Profiles](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7236/firefox-profiles/) makes it easy to launch Firefox with a specific profile from the indicator menu.
