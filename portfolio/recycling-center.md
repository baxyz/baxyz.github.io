# Recycling Center

## Project Overview

This mini project aims to optimize the management of a recycling center, specifically handling used oils, drain oils, and cleaning oils. The goal is to develop a highly efficient mobile application in terms of usability. Two versions are planned: one for the recycling center manager and one for the delivery personnel. Additionally, the project aims to provide predictive capabilities to the delivery personnel, allowing them to assess the center's capacity before starting their route.

## Use Case

**Morning Routine for Recycling Center Manager**

Every morning, the recycling center manager logs into the mobile application and updates the actual levels of the tanks for used oils, drain oils, and cleaning oils. This data is then synchronized with the central database.

**Predictive Planning for Delivery Personnel**

Throughout the day, delivery personnel use the mobile application to input their predicted oil collection levels. This information is also synchronized with the central database.

**Route Optimization for Delivery Personnel**

Before starting their route, a delivery person logs into the mobile application to check the predicted levels of all recycling centers. Based on their current location and the quantities of oil they have collected, the application suggests the most optimal recycling center to visit. This recommendation takes into account the predicted capacities of all available centers, ensuring efficient and effective route planning.
